/*Design a system where a button triggers ADC conversion via EXTI interrupt.
 * The ADC value should determine the PWM duty cycle. Display the duty cycle and ADC value on LCD.
 * Show the corresponding brightness change in LED using PWM.
 * Further, once the PWM is updated, trigger a USART message saying "PWM updated" on LCD.  */
